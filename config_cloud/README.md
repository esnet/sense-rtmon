# Cloud Stack Initialization Configuration

## Clean Slate Environment
- `hostIP`: IP address of the host where `cloud stack` runs on (e.g. 198.124.151.8)
- `ssl_certificate`: if the site already has been encrypted, provide the path of fullchain. If not leave it blank
- `ssl_certificate_key`: provide the path of prvikey
- with these information, it's sufficient to deploy `cloud stack` but not enough to generate dashboard
- see `config_flow` on needed information to generate dashboard
